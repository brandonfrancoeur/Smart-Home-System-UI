Usage:

To run the program, run the following command in the command line:
```
gradlew run
```
In order to access the system, a user account must be created using the create user button on the login page.
A non-administator user can only see and access the devices that are already available. They cannot add/remove devices or see the activity log. They also can't turn off/ turn on the hub device.

Other things to Note:
*When entering a new temperature, enter must be pressed in order to register it
*There is no config page for the light bulbs or smart plugs, their functionality is handled in the general devices page
*The hub system must be turned on from the administrator control page in order to access the other devices
*To remove users or devices, select one from the respective list, then press the respective remove button


What is missing:
*Offline storage component
*Notification section
