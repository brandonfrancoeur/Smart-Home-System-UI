**Usage:**

To run the program, run the following command in the command line:
```
gradlew run
```
In order to access the system, a user account must be created using the create user button on the login page.
A non-administator user can only see and access the devices that are already available. They cannot add/remove devices or see the activity log. They also can't turn off/ turn on the hub device.

**Other things to note:**
* When entering a new temperature, enter must be pressed in order to register it
* There is no config page for the light bulbs or smart plugs, their functionality is handled in the general devices page
* The hub system must be turned on from the administrator control page in order to access the other devices
* To remove users or devices, select one from the respective list, then press the respective remove button


**What is missing:**
* Offline storage component
* Notification section

**What I learned:**

This was the largest project that I did during university. I was responsible for writing the code for the login page, thermostat, and camera sections. I also wrote the automated tests for these devices. My partner and I collaborated heavily for the main page and the overall structure of the project. This assignment really helped to solidify the main priniples of object oriented design for me.

I'd like to thank my partner, Jonathan Kelly for his help on this assignment. You can find his profile here: [Jon's Page](https://github.com/Jkellys).
